                <h2>"You don't need to tighten yourself up and wind yourself up and 
            become an extra-ordinary person. 
            You need to climb up and get a better view of an extraordinary God" - Paul Washer</h2>

            <p>That was absolutely wonderful, and the first person that came to mind is Zacchaeus 
            climbing up the tree to get a better view of Jesus (Luke 19:1 -  10) 
            ðŸ˜…(I don't mean to spiritualize this section). 
            May the good LORD give us a greater hunger and thirst that leads to a greater knowledge of Him</p>
